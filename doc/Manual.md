# Introduction #

***LameXP*** is a graphical user-interface (GUI front-end) for various of audio encoders and decoders: It allows you to convert your audio files from one audio format to another one in the most simple way. Despite its name, LameXP is **not** only a front-end for the LAME MP3 encoder, but supports a wide range of *output formats*, including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, AAC/MP4, FLAC, AC-3 and Wave Audio. The number of supported *input formats* is even bigger! Furthermore LameXP **not** only runs on Windows XP, but also on Windows 7, 8 and 10 as well as other operating systems. 32-Bit *and* 64-Bit systems are supported.

![](http://lamexp.sourceforge.net/lamexp.png)

Since all the encoders and decoders that are used by the LameXP software are already *built-in* (with one exception), you do **not** need to install any additional software, such as "Codecs", "Filters" or "Plug-ins", on your computer. Everything works "out of the box". You can even use LameXP as a "portable" application, i.e. you can run LameXP directly off your USB stick. Moreover, LameXP was designed for *batch processing*. This means that you can convert a huge number of audio files, e.g. a complete album or even your entire music collection, in just a single step. At the same time, LameXP is able to process several audio files *concurrently*, so it can take full advantage of modern *multi-core* processors! However, LameXP is **not** only optimized for speed, it also provides excellent sound quality by using the most sophisticated audio encoders available.

In addition to that, LameXP provides full support for *meta information*, including cover artwork. So when converting your audio files with LameXP, any existing meta information will be retained &ndash; to the highest possible extent. Of course, there also is an easy-to-use *meta-tag editor* for adding new meta information or managing the existing meta information. On top of it all, LameXP provides full *Unicode support*, for meta information as well as file names, thus problems with "intentional" character sets are avoided. Likewise, thanks to our *translators*, the user-interface of the LameXP software is available in many different languages, including English, German, Spanish and Chinese. Last but not least, LameXP supports a number of post-processing filters, including sample rate conversion, normalization (gain adjustment), tone adjustment as well as down-mixing.

# Anti-Virus Notes #

Occasionally, it may happen that your anti-virus software *mistakenly* detects [malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) (virus, trojan horse, worm, etc.) while you are trying to run the LameXP application or the LameXP setup program. This is called a [**false positive**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#Problems_caused_by_false_positives) and the file actually is **not** malware. Instead, this is an error (bug) in your particular anti-virus software! In case that you encounter this kind problem, we highly recommend using [VirusTotal.com](http://www.virustotal.com/), [Virscan.org](http://www.virscan.org/) or a similar web-service to check the file in question with *multiple* anti-virus engines. Unless the vast majority of the anti-virus engines detect malware, it can be assumed that the file is really harmless. However, please take care with *heuristic* scan results, such as "suspicious", "generic" or "packed". Those results are **not** malware detections &ndash; they are highly speculative and (almost certainly) can be ignored safely!

Defective anti-virus software is an ongoing annoyance! For example, anti-virus programs tend to suspect installers (or uninstallers) created with [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) &ndash; which includes the LameXP setup program. But, of course, installers created with NSIS are perfectly legitimate. Thus, if your anti-virus program complains about the LameXP setup program, please ignore the *nonsensical* warning! Furthermore, it seems that some anti-virus programs accuse *all* "packed" executables of being malware. Nonetheless, using so-called "executable packers", e.g. [UPX](http://upx.sourceforge.net/), is perfectly legitimate. Executable packers are commonly used by legitimate software, including numerous OpenSource projects &ndash; and so does LameXP. Thus, if your anti-virus program complains about the LameXP program file, because it has been "packed" by UPX, please ignore the *nonsensical* warning!

Last but not least: Always keep in mind that LameXP is *free software*, which means that the *source codes* of LameXP are freely available. Everybody can easily see that there is ***no*** malware of any kind included in the LameXP source code! If you do *not* trust the provided *binaries* of LameXP, you may build your own binary directly from the LameXP source codes&hellip;


## Reporting False Positives ##

An important fact to consider is, that, for the developer of a legitimate application, it is *impossible* to know **why** a specific anti-virus software may be *misinterpreting* his or her application as malware. That is because anti-virus programs generally are *proprietary* (ClosedSource) software &ndash; anti-virus companies don *not* publish their source codes or reveal their algorithms. Moreover, a zillion of *different* anti-virus programs exist nowadays. For these reasons, the application developer can *not* know what is going on "behind the scenes" in a particular anti-virus software. Consequently, any assumptions on the reasons that are causing the [**false positive**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#Problems_caused_by_false_positives) would be nothing but pure speculation! Even worse, anti-virus software is updated frequently, so the reasons why the anti-virus software is *misinterpreting* the application as malware may change constantly!

At this point, it should be clear that implementing *workarounds* for defective anti-virus software is **not** a viable option for application developers. Instead, since the [**false positive**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#Problems_caused_by_false_positives) is an error (bug) in the particular *anti-virus software*, it can be fixed *only* by the developer of the anti-virus software. Therefore, it is important that *you*, the (paying) customer of the anti-virus company, contact the support team of the anti-virus company and report the problem to them! Most anti-virus companies provide ways to report *false positives* in a standardized way, e.g. by means of a [webform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_%28HTML%29). However, it is *not* possible to list them all here. So please refer to the anti-virus developer's web-site. Also, when reporting *false positives*, please be self-confident! As a *paying customer*, you can demand that *false positives* are fixed promptly. Otherwise, get your money back!


## Performance Issues ##

During the *startup procedure*, the LameXP software has to perform a number of *file-system* operations. This can take a few moments. However, the startup procedure should **never** take longer than *approximately* 5 seconds. Even on our test system &ndash; Windows 7 running on an *ancient* Intel Core2 processor with 4 GB of RAM &ndash; the startup procedure takes only about 1.5 seconds. And that is with the "real-time protection" of Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) enabled! If we disable the MSE "real-time protection" feature, the startup procedure takes less than 0.5 seconds. *Unfortunately*, it has been brought to our attention, that some other anti-virus products may *slow down* the startup procedure significantly! Startup delays of up to 20 seconds have been reported by users, which corresponds to a slow down factor of **40&#xd7;** &ndash; caused by the anti-virus software!

Consequently, if you think that LameXP is starting up "slow" on your machine, we recommend to **temporarily** *disable* or *uninstall* your current anti-virus software. If your anti-virus software has a so-called "real-time protection" or "guard" feature, please be sure to *deactivate* that feature too! As soon as the anti-virus software has been *neutralized* and **no** longer affects legitimate applications, please try launching the LameXP software again. If it turns out that the startup procedure of LameXP has become significantly *faster* when the anti-virus software is **not** interfering, then you know one thing for sure: It is the *anti-virus software* that was causing the slow down! Please recognize that *we* can **not** fix this kind of problems. Instead, since the problem is actually a *defect* of the anti-virus software, please report the problem to the developer of the *anti-virus software*!

Another way of detecting performance issues that are caused by sloppy anti-virus software is monitoring the CPU usage in Task Manager (or [*Process Explorer*](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx)) while LameXP is starting up. Please make sure that you are **not** looking at the "overall" CPU usage, but at the CPU usage caused by the *individual* processes, and that "show processes from all users" is *enabled*. Then you will probably notice that `LameXP.exe` is sitting "idle", more or less, while some *service process* belonging to the anti-virus software is "hogging" the CPU. The anti-virus software is hindering LameXP startup! A typical example looks like this:

![](img/lamexp/av_gone_mad.png)

Please report *performance issues* to the anti-virus software's developer. Also, when reporting *performance issues*, please be self-confident! As a *paying customer*, you can demand that such *bugs* are fixed promptly. Otherwise, get your money back!


## Anti-Virus Conclusions ##

The **code of conduct** regarding problems and annoyances related to so-called "anti-virus" software:

* If your anti-virus software raises an "alarm" or "warning" while trying to launch the LameXP software or the LameXP setup program, please do **not** panic! In most cases, it is just the anti-virus software that went insane.

* Unless the alleged "malware infection" has been confirmed by **multiple** [*different*](http://www.virustotal.com/) anti-virus engines, this (almost) certainly is a [**false positive**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#Problems_caused_by_false_positives), i.e. **not** an "infection" at all. Therefore, it can be ignored safely &#x1f60a;

* In the extremely unlikely case that you actually have a *confirmed* malware infection, please try re-downloading the LameXP software from one of the **official** mirrors first, *before* you send us any "malware" reports!

* If you encounter any [**false positives**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#Problems_caused_by_false_positives), please report these problems to the developer of the *defective* anti-virus software. *We* are **not** responsible for this problem (it is a bug in the anti-virus software) and thus *we* can **not** fix it!



# Install Instructions #

This chapter explains how to install the LameXP software on your computer. If LameXP has already been installed on your computer, you may skip this chapter.


## Install the LameXP Software ##

Distribution packages of the LameXP software is provided in two different flavours: a self-running **setup program** and a **ZIP package**. For regular users, using the *setup program* is highly recommended!


### Setup Program ###

In order to start the installation process, simply double-click on the downloaded LameXP **setup program**, e.g. ``LameXP.yyyy-mm-dd.Release-Static.Build-xxxx.exe``.

Shortly after launching the setup program, an [UAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control) (User Access Control) dialogue may appear. This is a standard Windows security feature, so don't worry! You have to choose "Yes", if you wish to continue the installation process.

![](img/lamexp/setup_1a.png)

Now simply follow the instructions of the setup wizard, which will guide you through the installation process&hellip;

*Note:* Please do **not** change the "Destionation Folder", unless you know exactly what you are doing. The "Destionation Folder" cannot be changed, when *upgrading* an existing LameXP installation.

![](img/lamexp/setup_1b.png)

Congratulation, LameXP has been installed successfully on your computer!

If you keep "Run LameXP &hellip;" enabled and click on the "Finish" button, LameXP software will be launched immediately.

![](img/lamexp/setup_1c.png)


### ZIP Package ###

If you decided for the **ZIP package**, open the downloaded ZIP file, e.g. ``LameXP.yyyy-mm-dd.Release-Static.Build-xxxx.zip``, with your favorite file archiver utility (we recommend using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)).

![](img/lamexp/setup_2a.png)

Now select **all** files in the LameXP ZIP archive and *extract* them to a new/empty directory of your choice. This step may be slightly different, depending on what file archive software (e.g. 7-Zip or WinRAR) you are using.

![](img/lamexp/setup_2b.png)

Congratulation, LameXP has been installed successfully on your computer! Now all you need to do is double-clicking on the `LameXP.exe` program file in order to launch the application!

![](img/lamexp/setup_2c.png)


## Portable Mode ##

First of all, it is important to note that there is **no** such thing as a *separate* "portable version" or "portable edition" of the LameXP software. Instead, **all** versions of the LameXP software always *are* "portable" &ndash; in the sense that the LameXP software is *fully self-contained* and thus **no** additional dependencies (libraries, frameworks, codecs or whatsoever) need to be installed on the computer separately. Or, in other words, the LameXP software is designed to work "out of the box". And this applies regardless of whether you choose the setup program or the ZIP package!

Nonetheless, the LameXP software supports a so-called "portable mode", which can be enabled or disabled at any time. By default, i.e. when the "portable mode" is **not** enabled, LameXP will store all of its configuration files in the current user's [``%APPDATA%``](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Windows) directory. This is the correct way of storing *user-specific* configuration files on a modern multi-user operating system. Some users, however, may wish to use LameXP as a *portable application*. For example, they may wish to run the LameXP software directly off an USB flash drive &ndash; and do that on many *different* machines. In this particular situation, storing the configuration files in the *same* location where the LameXP program file resides (e.g. on the USB flash drive), instead of the local ``%APPDATA%`` directory, may come in handy! And that is exactly what LameXP does when the "portable mode" is *enabled*.


### Enable the Portable Mode ###

In order to enable the "portable mode" of LameXP, simply **rename** the program file `LameXP.exe` to `LameXP-Portable.exe`. Please be aware that you must exit all running instances of LameXP, before you can rename the program file!

*Note:* By default, the LameXP installation directory is either ``C:\Program Files (x86)\MuldeR\LameXP`` or ``C:\Program Files\MuldeR\LameXP``. However, this can be changed by the user during the setup process.

![](img/lamexp/setup_3a.png)


#### Portable Mode Warning #### {-}

While the "portable mode" is in effect, it is the *user's* responsibility to ensure that LameXP will be provided with the proper access rights to save/load its configuration files to/from the LameXP program directory!

*Note:* The directories ``C:\Program Files (x86)`` and ``C:\Program Files`` usually are "protected" by the operating system, so LameXP probably will **not** be able to write into these directories.


### Disable the Portable Mode ###

If you wish to *disable* the "portable mode" again, then all you need to do is **renaming** the LameXP program file form ``LameXP-Portable.exe`` back to ``LameXP.exe``. You must exit LameXP, before you can rename the program file!

*Note:* After the "portable mode" has been *disabled*, any configurations files that may have been created in the LameXP installation directory will **no** longer be recognized. Therefore, you can delete these files safely&hellip;


## Install the AAC Encoder ##

For legal reasons, the AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder can **not** be included in the official LameXP distribution packages. Therefore, you need to download and install the AAC encoder *manually*. Don't worry, it's easy!

LameXP can use the **Nero Digital** AAC encoder as well as the **QAAC** (Apple iTunes/QuickTime) encoder. This chapter describes how to set up one of these AAC encoders for use with the LameXP software.

*Note:* If you are uncertain which AAC encoder to choose, please be aware that the QAAC encoder is known to produce better sound quality (at the same bitrate), according to [listening tests](http://listening-tests.hydrogenaud.io/igorc/aac-96-a/results.html), while the Nero Digital encoder is easier to install.


### QAAC (Apple AAC) Encoder ###

Setting up the Apple/QuickTime AAC encoder involves *two* separate steps: In the first step we will install the QAAC application, and in the second step we will add the required Apple AAC encoder libraries.


#### Install QAAC Encoder #### {-}

First of all, you need to download the [**QAAC**](https://github.com/nu774/qaac) application, which provides a CLI font-end to the Apple/QuickTime AAC encoder. QAAC is provided as an **add-in** for LameXP and is available from the following download locations:

* <http://sourceforge.net/projects/lamexp/files/Miscellaneous/Add-ins/qaac/>
* <http://muldersoft.com/misc/lamexp/add-ins/qaac/>
* <http://www.mediafire.com/folder/hmdfud5buajuh/qaac>

Now open the downloaded ZIP file, e.g. ``LameXP.qaac-addin.yyyy-mm-dd.zip``, with your favorite file archiver utility (we recommend using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)) to find the required QAAC program files.

*Note:* The LameXP software generally expects the **latest** version of the QAAC add-in; and the QAAC add-in is designed to work with the **latest** version of the LameXP software. Make sure your files are up-to-date!

![](img/lamexp/setup_5a.png)

Please *extract* the program file `qaac.exe` as well as the DLLs files `libsoxr.dll` and `libsoxconvolver.dll` into the LameXP installation directory. That is the directory where your LameXP executable file, i.e. the ``LameXP.exe``, is located.

Alternately, if running on a 64-Bit (x64) version of Windows, you may also use the 64-Bit version of the QAAC program. In this case, extract `qaac64.exe` as well as `libsoxr64.dll` and `libsoxconvolver64.dll` into the LameXP installation directory. Also, if you want to use an optimized "SSE2" or "AVX2" version of QAAC, which requires support from the CPU, the file `qaac.sse2.exe`, `qaac.avx2.exe` or `qaac64.avx2.exe` must be *renamed* to `qaac.exe` or `qaac64.exe`, respectively.

*Note:* By default, the LameXP installation directory is either ``C:\Program Files (x86)\MuldeR\LameXP`` or ``C:\Program Files\MuldeR\LameXP``. However, this can be changed by the user during the setup process.

![](img/lamexp/setup_5b.png)


#### Install Apple AAC Encoder Libraries #### {-}

Next, the actual Apple/QuickTime AAC encoder libraries (CoreAudioToolbox), which are part of the so-called "Apple Application Support" package, need to be installed on your computer. QAAC can **not** work without these libraries!

The required "Apple Application Support" package is included, for example, in the official setup packages of *QuickTime* or *iTunes* for Windows, which can be obtained from the Apple web-site free of charge.

A more simple approach is to download the required Apple/QuickTime AAC encoder libraries as a *standalone* package, as kindly provided by GitHub user "AnimMouse", which can be obtained from the following download locations:

* <https://github.com/AnimMouse/QTFiles/releases>
* <https://archive.org/download/qtfiles-icudt-62.dll>
* <https://www.mediafire.com/folder/z6xwtgadnv7qe/qaac-qtfiles-v12.10.11>
* <https://mega.nz/folder/AysxkLDb#CbOTCNdAK9OBveoNmDbHxw>

*Note:* If you are using the 32-Bit version of QAAC (`qaac.exe`), the package `QTfiles.7z` needs to be obtained. But, if you are using the 64-Bit version of QAAC (`qaac64.exe`), the package `QTfiles64.7z` needs to be obtained instead!

![](img/lamexp/setup_5c.png)

Finally, extract the *complete* contents of the package `QTfiles.7z` or `QTfiles64.7z` into a new sub-directory named `QTfiles` or `QTfiles64`, respectively, inside of the the LameXP installation directory.

If a suitable version of the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) is **not** already installed on your system, then you must *additionally* download and extract the package `QTfiles-msvc.7z` or `QTfiles64-msvc.7z` into the same sub-directory.

![](img/lamexp/setup_5d.png)

Once the QAAC encoder application as well as the required Apple AAC encoder libraries have been installed properly, simply *restart* LameXP in order to enable the AAC encoding support!

You may run `qaac.exe --check` from the [command prompt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) in order to ensure that QAAC has been set up correctly.

![](img/lamexp/setup_5e.png)


### Nero Digital AAC Encoder ###

First of all, you need to download the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310025758/http://www.nero.com:80/enu/company/about-nero/nero-aac-codec.php"><b>Nero AAC Codec</b></a> (Version 1.5.4) as a ZIP archive from one of the following mirror sites, because the original Nero AAC product web-site no longer seems to be functional:

* <https://archive.org/details/nero-aaccodec-1.5.4>
* <https://www.videohelp.com/software/Nero-AAC-Codec>
* <https://www.free-codecs.com/download/Nero_AAC_Codec.htm>
* <https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/nero_aac_codec_(formerly_nero_digital_audio).html>

Now open the downloaded ZIP file `NeroAACCodec-1.5.4.zip` with your favourite file archiver utility (we recommend using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)) and then navigate to the "win32" sub-directory.

![](img/lamexp/setup_4b.png)

Finally, *extract* all the three files ``neroAacDec.exe``, ``neroAacEnc.exe`` and ``neroAacTag.exe`` into the LameXP installation directory. That is the directory where your LameXP executable file, i.e. the ``LameXP.exe``, is located.

*Note:* By default, the LameXP installation directory is either ``C:\Program Files (x86)\MuldeR\LameXP`` or ``C:\Program Files\MuldeR\LameXP``. However, this can be changed by the user during the setup process.

![](img/lamexp/setup_4c.png)

Once all of the required Nero AAC encoder program files have been installed  to the proper location, simply *restart* LameXP in order to enable the AAC encoding support!



# Tutorial (Step-by-Step Guide) #

This tutorial will teach you, step by step, how to convert your audio files using the LameXP software. The tutorial assumes that LameXP is already installed on your computer.


## Source Files ##

First of all, you need to add all **source files** that you want to convert. So switch to the "Source Files" tab, just in case that tab is not active already, and then click the "Add File(s)" button.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_1a.png)

This will bring up a standard file selection dialogue. Now simply select the files that you want to add and click the "Open" button. You can repeat this step multiple times, e.g. to add files from different directories.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_1b.png)

All files you have added, so far, will show up in the list. You can click the "Remove" button to remove a single file from the list or "Clear" to remove them all. You can also click the "Show details" button to show details about the selected file.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_1c.png)

If you want to add an *entire* directory, you can select "Open Folder" from the "File" menu, which will bring up a directory selection dialogue. "Open Folder Recursively" works in a similar way, but also includes *all* sub-directories.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_1d.png)

*Did you know?* Files can also be added via [Drag &amp; Drop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_and_drop). Just grab the files that you want to add in your Explorer window and drop them onto the LameXP main window (or onto the LameXP "dropbox" widget).


## Output Directory ##

Next, you need to choose the **output directory**, i.e. the directory where the converted files will be saved. Switch to the "Output Directory" tab and choose the desired output directory from the directory tree view.

*Note:* There are several quick navigation buttons below, which will allow you to jump quickly to your personal "Home" folder, "Desktop" folder and "Music" folder, respectively.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_2a.png)

Sometimes you may wish to store the converted files in a *new* (sub-)folder. In this case, simply click the "Make New Folder" button, enter the desired folder name and hit the "OK" button.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_2b.png)

The new folder is going to be created inside the current directory and will be selected automatically. You can repeat this step multiple times in order to created nested sub-folders.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_2c.png)

*Did you know?* If you enable the "Save output files in the same directory where the input file is located" option, each output file will be saved to the same location where the corresponding source file resides.


## Compression Settings ##

Finally, you need to choose your **compression settings**. Most important, you must decide for an output *format (encoder)*. Depending on your needs and preferences, you can choose between [MP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3), [Ogg/Vorbis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis), [Opus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_%28audio_format%29), [AAC/MP4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding), [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/) and others.

*Note:* If you are uncertain which audio format to choose, then [this article](http://lifehacker.com/5927052/whats-the-difference-between-all-these-audio-formats-and-which-one-should-i-use) by Lifehacker is a good starting point. Also see the [comparison of audio coding formats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_audio_coding_formats) on Wikipedia. If still uncertain, just go with good old MP3 &#x1f609;

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_3a.png)

Once you have decided for an audio format, you need to choose a *rate-control* mode next. This controls how the bits are allocated for the compressed audio files. The available rate-control modes are *CBR*, *VBR* and *ABR*:

- CBR (constant bitrate) uses a *fixed* bitrate, i.e. each segment of the file receives the exactly same amount of bits, regardless of its contents. This comes at the advantage that the resulting file size is perfectly predictable. However, because the bitrate can *not* be adapted to the contents of the file at all, this generally is the *least* favorable mode!

- VBR (quality-base variable bitrate) mode adapts the bitrate to the contents of the file. Each segment of the file receives as many bits as are required to hit the target quality level. This means that "complex" segments of the file will end up with a higher bitrate than more "simple" segments. The bits will be used where they are actually needed. However, because the bitrate varies strongly depending on the contents of the file, the resulting file size is completely unpredictable!

- ABR (average bitrate) mode can be understood as a "middle course" between VBR and CBR mode. Similar to VBR mode, ABR mode adapts the bitrate to the contents of the file. But, at the same time, similar to CBR mode, ABR mode limits the bitrate variation in order to hit the specified target *average* bitrate, i.e. the resulting file size *is* predictable.

*Note:* If you are uncertain which rate-control mode to chose, the rule of thumb is that VBR mode should be preferred over ABR mode when possible. And CBR mode should be avoided. See also Wikipedia's article on [variable bitrate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_bitrate) encoding.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_3b.png)

Last but not least, you need to choose the desired target *bitrate* (kbps) or the desired *quality-level*. Put simply, this controls the "quality vs. file size" trade-off. You choose a target quality-level in case of VBR mode. And you choose a target (average) bitrate in case of ABR or CBR mode. A *higher* target bitrate or a *higher* target quality level results in improved audio quality, but also comes at the cost of larger files. Conversely, a *lower* target bitrate or a *lower* target quality level results in smaller files, but also comes at the cost of reduced audio quality. The "optimal" setting highly depends on your personal preferences.

*Note:* If you are uncertain which bitrate or quality-level to choose, "Level 2" (VBR) or "192 kbps" (ABR) is a common choice for MP3. If the size of the resulting file is *not* a primary concern, you can go with "Level 0" (VBR) or "320 kbps" (ABR) right away.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_3c.png)

*Did you know?* You can click the "Reset" link in order to reset *all* compression settings for *all* encoders to their factory defaults.


## File Processing ##

When everything has been set up properly, the time has come to actually start the encoding process. So simply click the "Encode Now" button in order to get going!

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_4a.png)

This will bring up the "Processing" dialogue. LameXP will now convert all your audio files on the list. Depending on the number of audio files and depending on the performance of your system, this may take several minutes, so please be patient &#x1f609;

*Note:* In order to leverage the power "multi-core" processors and thus massively speed-up the encoding process, LameXP will run multiple encoding jobs in parallel &ndash; provided that your system has multiple processor cores and that there are enough encoding jobs left in the queue.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_4b.png)

The "Processing" dialogue is going to turn *green*, as soon as all encoding jobs have finished successfully. If anything went wrong, e.g. if one of the encoding jobs failed for some reason, it will turn *red* instead.

![](img/lamexp/tutorial_4c.png)

*Did you know?* You can double-click on a completed (or failed) job in the list, in order to bring up a dialogue with all details about the specific job. This is especially useful, if something went wrong.



# Command-line Usage #

Additional **[command-line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) options** may be passed to LameXP when launching the application. You may do so, for example, by typing the complete command-line into the [*command prompt*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) or by creating a [*shortcut*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_shortcut) with the desired command-line options. The basic command-line syntax of LameXP is as follows: Each command-line option has to start with a ``--`` prefix. So if you intend to pass the option called "foo", then you actually need to type ``--foo``. Furthermore, while some command-line options are just *flags*, i.e. they can either be present or not (but that's it!), there also are command-line options that take an *argument*. The argument is *appended* directly to the option name to which it belongs to, but a ``=`` sign **must** to be inserted as a separator. If, for example, you wish to set the command-line option "foo" to an argument value of "bar", then the proper syntax is ``--foo=bar``. Sometimes your argument value may contain *whitespaces* though, in which case the *whole* command-line option (name + argument) **must** be enclosed with double quotes. For example, in order to set the option "foo" to a value of "C:\Some File.bar" (note the space character between "Some" and "File"), the proper syntax is ``"--foo=C:\Some File.bar"``. Last but not least, please note that the *same* command-line option may appear *multiple* times on the command-line &ndash; whether that actually makes any sense depends on the individual option though.


## Add Files and/or Folders ##

Command-line options for adding files and/or folders:

* ``--add=filename``
  Adds the file specified by *filename* to the source files list. The *filename* should be a [fully-qualified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_name#Filenames_and_paths) path. If you wish to add multiple files at once, you can simply include this option multiple times.

* ``--add-folder=directory``
  Adds *all* supported files from the directory specified by *directory* to the source files list. The *directory* should be a [fully-qualified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_name#Filenames_and_paths) path. Sub-directories are **not** considered.

* ``--add-recursiver=directory``
  This option works just like the "add-folder" option, except that it works recursively, i.e. it *does* take into account sub-directories. Use this option with care, since a whole lot of files may be added.


### Examples ###

Here are some *examples* on how to use the above command-line options correctly:

* Add one file:
  ``LameXP.exe "--add=C:\Some Folder\Some File.mp3"``

* Add multiple files at once:
  ``LameXP.exe "--add=C:\Some Folder\File #1.mp3" "--add=C:\Some Folder\File #2.mp3" "--add=C:\Some Folder\File #3.mp3"``

* Add a whole directory:
 ``LameXP.exe "--add-folder=C:\Some Folder"``


## GUI Adjustment Options ##

Command-line options for adjusting the graphical user-interface:

* ``--huge-font``
  Set the font scaling factor to 150%. Use this if you want *much* larger fonts.

* ``--big-font``
  Set the font scaling factor to 125%. Use this if you want *somewhat* larger fonts.

* ``--small-font``
  Set the font scaling factor to 87.5%. Use this if you want *somewhat* smaller fonts.

* ``--tiny-font``
  Set the font scaling factor to 75%. Use this if you want *much* smaller fonts.


## Options for Debugging ##

Command-line options that are intended for testing and debugging:

* ``--console``
  Enable the LameXP debug console. Use this option with "release" builds of LameXP, where the console is hidden by default.

* ``--no-console``
  The opposite of the "console" option: Disable the LameXP debug console. Use this option with "pre-release" (beta) builds of LameXP, where the console is visible by default.

* ``--force-cpu-no-64bit``
  Treat the CPU as if it did **not** support [64-Bit (x64)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) applications, even when it actually does so.

* ``--force-cpu-no-sse``
  Treat the CPU as if it did **not** support any [SSE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) extensions (SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSSE4, etc), even when it actually does so.

* ``--force-cpu-no-intel``
  Treat the CPU as if it was a *non*-Intel processor, even when the vendor tag indicates an Intel processor.

* ``--ignore-compat-mode``
  Do **not** check whether the application is running with "compatibility mode" enabled. It's still *not* recommended to run with compatibility mode enabled!


## Miscellaneous Options ##

Miscellaneous command-line options that may come in handy in certain situations:

* ``--no-splash``
  Do **not** show the "splash" screen while application is starting up. Be aware that this will *not*  (considerably) improve the application startup time, because the same initialization work still needs to be performed!

* ``--kill``
  Exit all running instances of LameXP.

* ``--force-kill``
  Exit all running instances of LameXP as quickly as possible, even if that incurs data loss!

# Developer Center #

While LameXP originally was written in Delphi/Pascal, the current version 4 series of the software has been re-written in the [**C++**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programming language. LameXP v4 uses the [*Qt cross-platform application framework*](http://www.qt.io/) and provides full [*Unicode*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) support. Furthermore, LameXP is tightly coupled with the [*MUtilities*](https://github.com/lordmulder/MUtilities) library, a vast collection of "utility" routines and classes to extend the Qt framework. Build files are currently provided for *Microsoft Visual Studio* only. Linux support is currently provided via [*Wine*](https://www.winehq.org/); a native Linux port of LameXP is planned for a future version.

* Windows Platform SDK v7.1A, included with Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2013

* The minimum supported *build* platform is Windows 7 (x86 and x64)

In order to create LameXP release packages, using the included deployment scripts, you need the following additional tools:

* [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) &ndash; file archiver with a high compression ratio

* [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) &ndash; Nullsoft Scriptable Install System ([*Unicode version*](https://github.com/jimpark/unsis/releases) recommended!)
    + [StdUtils](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/StdUtils_plug-in) plug-in
    + [LockedList](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/LockedList_plug-in) plug-in
    + [Inetc](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in) plug-in

* [UPX](http://upx.sourceforge.net/) &ndash; the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables

* [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) &ndash; the Universal Document Converter

* [GnuPG](https://www.gpg4win.de/) &ndash; the GNU Privacy Guard (Gpg4win)


## Directory Layout

In order to build LameXP using the provided project/solution files or the provided deployment script, please make sure you have the following directory layout, where `<sources_root>` is a new/empty directory:

* `<sources_root>\LameXP_Qt` &ndash; the *LameXP* "main" project
* `<sources_root>\Prerequisites` &ndash; prerequisites to build LameXP
* `<sources_root>\MUtilities` &ndash; the *MUtilities* library

The *Qt* libraries need to be located at the following location, where the `<toolset_version>` identifies your compiler version (e.g. `v140_xp` for VS2015) and the `<build_type>` identifies the build configuration (`Shared`, `Static` or `Debug`):

* `<sources_root>\Prerequisites\Qt4\<toolset_version>\<build_type>`


## Environment variables

In order to build LameXP using the provided project/solution files or the provided deployment script, make sure the following environment variables are configured on your system:

* `QTDIR` &ndash; points to your Qt installation directory, such that `%QTDIR%\bin\moc.exe` and friends exist


## Using the deployment script

In order to create LameXP release packages, using the included deployment scripts, **copy** the *configuration* template file `buildenv.template.txt`, located at `<sources_root>\LameXP_Qt\etc\Deployment`, to the file `buildenv.txt` in the *same* directory. Now edit *your* `buildenv.txt` and adjust all the path variables as needed. All paths must be set up correctly, otherwise the build process is going to fail! Once everything has been set up, you can run `release.bat` or `release_static.bat` in order to create a new release package.


## Qt as Static Libraries ##

In order to create a "fully static" build of LameXP, i.e. a build that does *not* depend on any "external" DLL files (except for the obligatory operating system DLL's that you cannot get around), you'll need to compile Qt as "static" libraries. The official Qt web-site *does* provide pre-compiled Qt libraries. However, they only provide DLL versions, they do *not* provide "static" libraries. Consequently, you need to build the required "static" Qt libraries yourself. The following simple instructions should make it easy to build Qt from the sources and as "static" libraries:

 1. Make sure *Visual Studio 2015* with Update-1 (or later) is installed

 2. Make sure *Strawberry Perl *for Windows and *Python 2.7* are installed

 3. Download and extract the *Qt 4.8.x* source code package (e.g. to ``C:\QtSources\4.8.x``)

 4. Edit the *qmake* configuration file (e.g. ``mkspecs\win32-msvc2015\qmake.conf``) from your Qt Sources directory as follows:

    * Edit #1:
        + &lArr; ``QMAKE_CFLAGS_RELEASE = -O2 -MD``
        + &rArr; ``QMAKE_CFLAGS_RELEASE = -O2 -MT <more optimization flags here>``
    * Edit #2:
        + &lArr; ``QMAKE_CFLAGS_RELEASE_WITH_DEBUGINFO += -O2 -MD -Zi``
        + &rArr; ``QMAKE_CFLAGS_RELEASE_WITH_DEBUGINFO += -O2 -MT -Zi <more optimization flags here>``

 5. Open a new command window (``cmd.exe``) &ndash; use this very same console for all upcoming steps!

 6. Add *Strawberry Perl* to your PATH (e.g. ``set PATH=C:\strawberry\perl\bin;%PATH%``)

 7. Add *Python 2.7* to your PATH (e.g. ``set PATH=C:\python27;%PATH%``)

 8. Run ``vcvarsall.bat x86`` form your Visual C++ install directory - within the same console!

 9. Change the current directory to the *Qt Sources* path (e.g. ``C:\QtSources\4.8.x``)

10. Run ``configure.exe -release -static -ltcg -qt-zlib -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-libtiff -qt-libmng``

11. Now the makefiles should have been generated, so simply enter ``nmake /B`` and be patient - voilà!

12. The build process is going to take good amount of time. Once it is done, make sure you got all needed libs:

    + ``lib\qtmain.lib``
    + ``lib\QtCore.lib``
    + ``lib\QtGui.lib``
    + ``lib\QtSvg.lib``
    + ``lib\QtXml.lib``
    + ``plugins\imageformats\qico.lib``
    + ``plugins\imageformats\qsvg.lib``
    + ``plugins\imageformats\qtga.lib``

13. Put all the static *.lib files into the `<sources_root>\Prerequisites\Qt4\<toolset_version>\Static\lib` directory

14. ImageFormat plugins go to `<sources_root>\Prerequisites\Qt4\<toolset_version>\plugins\imageformats`

15. Congratulations, you should now be prepared to build the ``Release_Static`` configuration of LameXP &#x1f60a;

*Note:* Static libraries only work with the exactly same compiler (version) they were built with!



# F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions) #

This section tries to answer some of the most frequently asked questions. So if you have a question, please carefully read this section, before you send the question to us via email or before you open a new support ticket &#x1f609;


## Q: Do I have to pay for using or obtaining LameXP? ##

**A:** Nope. LameXP is [free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software). You may use it ***free of charge*** and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, according to the terms of the [*GNU General Public License*](GNU General Public License). The developers of LameXP will **never** ask you to pay for using the LameXP software. Also, several ***free*** download mirrors are provided. However, it was brought to our attention, that there are some *third-party* web-sites which offer *payed* downloads of LameXP, or provide LameXP downloads that have been infected with Adware &ndash; we do **not** cooperate with any of these web-sites! Therefore, please do **not** pay money for using or obtaining the LameXP software; the developers of LameXP will **not** benefit from this money at all.

## Q: Why is this software called *LameXP*? ##

**A:** Originally, the LameXP software was created as a very simple [GUI front-end](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) to the [*LAME*](http://lame.sourceforge.net/) MP3 command-line encoder. The original version of this software, released some time in 2004, did **not** support any encoders except for LAME, it did **not** support any input formats except for Wave Audio, it did **not** support any audio filters, it did **not** support multi-threading, it did **not** support Unicode file names and it did **not** handle meta information. Because the software was a front-end to LAME, and because, back at that time, *Windows XP* was the most popular Windows version (by far), we decided to call the software "LAME front-end for Windows XP" &ndash; or, in short, *LameXP*. Anyway, more and more features have been added to the LameXP software over the years. Also, the software has been re-written from the scratch two times. Nonetheless, the original name of the software has remained. Now, a whole lot of people know the software by *this* name, so it is unlikely to ever change.


## Q: Why are the LameXP binaries *not* digitally signed? ##

**A:** They *are* signed! The official LameXP binaries are digitally signed by [*PGP*](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) signatures, created using the [GnuPG](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) software. However, the LameXP binaries are *not* signed in a way that the Microsoft Windows operating system recognizes. Please note that Microsoft Windows does **not** currently recognize PGP (GnuPG) signatures. For this reason, Microsoft Windows may show a warning message when trying to launch or install the LameXP software. Microsoft Windows will also complain that the LameXP program files originate from an "unknown publisher", as it can't understand the PGP signature.

So why are the LameXP binaries not signed in the way Microsoft Windows recognizes? This is because Microsoft Windows uses a *hierarchical* trust model: Windows trusts into a number of *Certificate Authorities* (CA), which are built into the operating system. These CA's can issue signing certificates, e.g., to software companies. The software company can then use its signing certificate to sign their binaries. Finally, Windows will verify the signature by using the corresponding signing certificate. And the signing certificate is verified using the *built-in* CA certificate. However, there are problems: First of all, CA's do *not* issue software signing certificates for free. Also these certificates are only valid for a limited period of time. LameXP is a *non-profit* project and therefore we can *not* afford buying new certificates in regular intervals! Secondly, and even more important, the whole system depends on the *trustworthiness* of a few root CA's. But, as we all (should) know by now, the CA's *can* be forced to create "bogus" certificates, e.g. on the request of intelligence services or other governmental organizations.

PGP, on the other hand, is based on the "web of trust" concept. This means that all participants sign each others' keys &ndash; after the keys have been verified. There are **no** "almighty" authorities! If you want to verify the LameXP signatures yourself, then you may do so by using the [Gpg4win](http://www.gpg4win.de/) software package, an easy-to-use distribution of the *GnuPG* software for Microsoft Windows. Of course you will also require the *public* key of the LameXP developers! The *finperprint* of our PGP signing key is **`DFAD4340D83D4020435D78BB2B5913365F57E03F`** and the corresponding public key block is provided in the following. If you are *not* familiar with the GnuPG software yet, please have a look at the [Gpg4win compendium](http://www.gpg4win.de/documentation.html) or the [GnuPG manual](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.html).

## Q: Why does LameXP connect to (random) web-servers? ##

**A:** LameXP does **not** connect to any web-server, except for the "automatic updates" feature. Of course, in order to check for new updates, LameXP *unavoidably* has to communicate with our update servers. However, in **no** event LameXP will search for updates *without* your consent. Also, LameXP will **not** send any personal information to the update server. Instead of *uploading* your information, e.g. your current program version, to the web-server, LameXP will *download* the update information from the update server and compare it to your installed version locally. Furthermore, all information and program files downloaded from the update servers are protected by PGP (GnuPG) signatures, in order to assure the authenticity and integrity of these files. Files with missing/invalid signature are going to be *rejected*, so (spoofing) attacks are prevented.

*Note:* Before LameXP actually tries to download information from our update servers, it will check your Internet connection. Only checking whether the update server itself is reachable does **not** suffice here. In case that the update server does **not** respond, this could mean that our servers are currently experiencing problems, but it could also mean that your Internet connection is failing. In order to distinguish these cases, LameXP will validate the Internet connection prior to connecting to the update server. For this purpose, LameXP contains a rather long list of "known" hosts, taken mostly from [Alexa's Top 500](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) list. In order to validate the Internet connection, LameXP will pick a *random* host from the list and check whether that host can be reached. This process will be repeated, until a certain minimum number of "known" hosts have been reached.


## Q: Can LameXP convert tracks from an Audio CD?

**A:** LameXP *can* be used to convert audio files that have been extracted from an Audio CD, but it currently can **not** extract ("rip") the audio tracks from the Audio CD directly. Consequently you will have to extract the audio tracks first, before you can convert them with LameXP. We recommend using the [*Exact Audio Copy*](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/) software for that purpose. When ripping tracks from an Audio CD, always save the tracks as *uncompressed* Wave files (or as lossless FLAC files) in order to avoid quality loss!

*Warning:* The Windows Explorer will show CDA files (such as `Track01.cda`) on an Audio CD. These are just *dummy* files! Actually an Audio CD does **not** contain a file system. Thus there are **no** files either. There only are *audio tracks* on an Audio CD. These audio tracks *can* be extracted as files (e.g. Wave Audio files), by using a proper ripping software. Then the extracted files can be converted. At the same time, any attempt to convert the dummy `*.cda` files is **not** going to work!

## Q: Why does LameXP run (only) N instances in parallel?

**A:** LameXP can massively speed-up the encoding process by taking advantage of *multi-core* computers. This is achieved by running *multiple* encoder (or decoder) instances in parallel. Since most audio encoders are single-threaded and therefore can **not** utilize more than a single CPU core, LameXP will launch one encoder instance per (logical) CPU core, *by default*. This requires that there are (at least) as many audio files in the queue as there are CPU cores. Or, in other words, the number of encoder instances that can be run in parallel at any given moment is limited by the number of audio files left in the queue.

Furthermore, it is important to note that all encoder/decoder instances running in parallel will also need to read their input data from the disk and write back their output data to the disk. Therefore, running *too many* instances in parallel can easily result in a phenomenon called "disk thrashing" and actually slow down the overall encoding speed considerably! This is the reason why LameXP does **not** use a simple "1:1" mapping between the number of available CPU cores and the (maximum) number of instances to run in parallel. Instead, fewer instances will be created as the number of CPU cores grows. The [*exact curve*](https://i.imgur.com/6XYwr03.png) used to compute the "optimal" number of instances from the number of available CPU cores has been determined experimentally.

*Note:* In any case, the (maximum) number of parallel instances can be overwritten manually from the "Advanced Options" tab, even though this is **not** usually recommended. Also note that LameXP will now automatically detect solid-state drives (SSD) and similar drives. When such a drive was detected, LameXP will revert to a simple "1:1" mapping between the number of CPU cores and the (maximum) number of parallel instances &ndash; because "disk thrashing" is **not** normally a problem with such drives.


## Q: Is there a way to use *custom* binaries with LameXP?

**A:** LameXP is a GUI front-end that uses a number third-party tools. All of these tools are already "built-in", with only a few exceptions. Therefore it is **not** normally required to provide separate binaries &ndash; LameXP uses the built-in binaries by default. If,&nbsp;however, you wish to use a *custom* (user-provided) binary, rather than the built-in binary, then this is still possible!

In order to replace a "built-in" binary, simply put the user-provided binary to the following location:

	<install_folder>\tools\<build_number>\<tool_name>.exe

If, for example, you want to replace the binary `foobar.exe` and the current build number is **42**, then you'd use this path:

	C:\Path to your LameXP install folder\tools\42\foobar.exe

***Warning:*** LameXP has been carefully optimized to work properly with the *built-in* tool versions. Also, some of the built-in binaries even contain "unofficial" patches to make them work correctly with LameXP. If you replace any of these tools with a *custom* (user-provided) version, there is absolutely **no** guarantee that *your* tool version will work correctly with LameXP!
